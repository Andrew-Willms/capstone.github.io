_Andrew Willms, Christian Bergmann, Erik Smith, Jonathan Gervais, Josh Cooke_

&nbsp;
## The Needs We Have Observed
- Hockey goalies are often in short supply.
- Training tools exist for batters to practice hitting in baseball.
- No such tools exist to substitute for goalies in hockey.
- This results in hockey goalies being in very high demand for practice.
