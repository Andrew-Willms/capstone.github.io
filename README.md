&nbsp;
## The Needs We Have Observed
- Hockey goalies are often in short supply.
- Training tools exist for batters to practice hitting in baseball.
- No such tools exist to substitute for goalies in hockey.
- This results in hockey goalies being in very high demand for practice.

&nbsp;
## Problem Statement
Create a reactive hockey training device for players to practice against, removing the need for a human goalie.

| **Week 1**<br>09/08 | - observed needs<br>- created problem statement | - Consulted professor [Russell Buchanan](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/r6buchan) about CV options.<br>- Sourced IR lights and cameras for evaluating CV implementations. | Set up project management processes. | Started compiling a list of solution agnostic materials (e.g. power supply, generic construction materials) to obtain a rough budget estimate. | Spoke with hockey players and coaches to asses community needs. | CADed hockey net and crease to improve our understanding of the physical constraints of a hockey rink. |
